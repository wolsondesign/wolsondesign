          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>When my wife and I were getting married. We started planning for the wedding material. I did not want to design the pieces to start. I was wary of the difficulty of designing for myself and dealing with the bride at the same time. As I started looking at what we could get for what we were paying other designers. I decided we could get a better product for a better price if I did the designs myself. The rest of the project was a blast and exceeded my wildest expectations.</p>

          <h2>It all started with a tiger</h2>
          <p>I started by looking at stock photos to help find a creative direction for the pieces. I was going through photos and illustrations labeled “wedding”. But they were not cutting it because they did not represent us as a couple. Meagan and I are not your standard picture frame couple. So when I found an illustration of a tiger dressed like a human. It was love at first site.</p><img src="/img/work/wedding-collateral/wedding-collateral-tiger-01.jpg">
          <h2>Save the date</h2>
          <p>For the save the dates I wanted something that people will not only want to put on their fridge. I wanted people to keep it on their fridge way after the wedding. During my research, I found most save the dates used pictures of the couple. So I took the opposite direction and placed the tiger illustration front and center. I also liked using a tiger with an eye patch. Because it has a shock factor and symbolizes wild untamed love.</p>
          <p>We invited a wide range of people to the wedding. I divided the audience into two sections. Conservative grandmother and wildcard friends. We created two different versions of the card. One with a conservative headline and the other with a more wild headline. We received only positive feedback when we sent out the card. The cards accomplished my primary mission. That is to get people pumped for the wedding.</p>

          <h2>Invitation card</h2>
          <p>We created two pieces for the invitation. A card to place on the fridge and a RSVP card for the guests to send back. I found two other illustrations from Olga Angelloz that fit the theme of the save the date. The save the date had established many elements that I carried over into the invitations. I brought over the colors, font, and type treatment. Once the two illustrations were in place. I found a special heart glyph that I found in the primary font. Them I added it to the illustrations. The glyph helped to tie all the elements together.</p>
          <h2>Invitation RSVP mailer</h2>
          <p>As part of the invitations we sent out we included a self addressed post card. I wanted to create a fun way for our guests to send their response back. The idea to use a flowchart came from the back of Wired Magazine. I always love looking to see what all the options for answers could be. So I included a chart that told us how excited our friends and family about the wedding.</p>
          <h2>A happy wife makes for a happy designer</h2>
          <p>When we first started I thought this would be the toughest project I have ever worked on. It turned out to be one of the most fun projects I have ever worked on. I have to credit my wife for letting me have fun by pushing what a wedding mailer could be.</p>
