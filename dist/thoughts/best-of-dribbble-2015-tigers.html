              <p>The end of the year is near. So I wanted to look back on the year and showcase my favorite <a href="https://dribbble.com/" title="Dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> shots. This article is focusing on my Power Animal, the Tiger.</p>

              <p>I love the strength of this mark. The positive and negative spaces are perfectly balanced and readable. You are not going to look at this mark and think it's a Whale. The stern look is a unique take for a Tiger illustration. Normally Tiger illustrations focus on the beast in the Tiger. Instead the mark makes the Tiger strong and regal like a Lion. Because of this, the shot makes my list for this year.</p>

              <p>Where the shot above shows strength and regality. This shot goes in the opposite direction. It's wild and unpredictable. You don't know if the Tiger is going to eat a limb, scratch your face, or kill you. Either way it's not going to be good. But that is perfect for a motorcycle helmet. An industry known for renegades, badasses, and the like. If I had a motorcycle this is the helmet I would wear. I know it would act like an "If you can read this sticker".</p>

              <p>Just when you thought you were safe. BAM! Tigers is space! I love the retro space age cutout style of the illustrations. I can see this being made by a kid in his garage using his father's old magazines. This shot's energy and creativity drew me to this shot.</p>

              <p>Now that things have gotten weird let me direct you to this shot. A Spider Tiger hybrid is one of the scariest things I can think of. I can see <a title="Mastodon the metal band." href="http://www.mastodonrocks.com/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> making an album about this. I love the ferocity and otherworldliness of this shot.</p>

              <p>Now that I have scared everyone. Let's take it down a notch. I love how this simple line illustration is extremely readable and friendly and inviting. The sun burst, warm colors, and expression of the Tiger make this a successful design.  It says this was a rejected design. I reject their rejection, if I saw this on a label I would go out of my way to purchase it (I might be a little biased. Whatever).</p>

              <p>Single weight line illustrations are on fire this year. Brian is a master of this style and this shot is an example of it. I like how the shot balances the line between simplicity and complexity. He could have use the standard orange and black and then threw in the gold for good measure. But this would have been overkill. Instead he chose to rely on the strength of the positive and negative spaces to bring out the Tiger in the illustration. The shot wins in my book because of this.</p>

              <p>By no means is this all of the Tigers I captured this year. Check out my bucket to see more great Tiger illustrations.</p>
