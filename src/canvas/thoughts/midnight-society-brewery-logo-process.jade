          p Midnight Society Brewing is a side project that I work on with my girlfriend Meaghan Jansen. Beyond brewing our own craft brew, we produce beer ice cream, bottle cap magnets, and beer bottle tumblers. This company is the sister company of my t-shirt business Midnight Society Apparel. The logos were developed together to complement each other.
          p We came up with the name for the company while we were brain storming. The discussions we had revolved around our favorite things from our childhood. We made a list of the things we discussed. We decided to make the company name a reference to one of our favorite shows "Are You Afraid of the Dark?". The group that told stories in the show was called "The Midnight Society".
          p The logo was inspired by the fire that the children told their stories around. This project is our way of connecting with people and sharing what we enjoy making with others. The campfire fire is a perfect icon for displaying connections with people. The fire also represents our passion for innovation. We like to take our ideas and run with them. Whether we are creating beer ice cream or making a fusion beer.

          p We initially wanted to focus solely on producing ice cream beer. So our initial logo drawing related to that aspect of the business. I was playing off of icons for both ice cream and beer then combining them together.
          img(src="/img/thoughts/midnight-society-brewery-logo-process-2.jpg" alt="Sketches of the logo for Midnight Society")
          p We then decided to the create a logo that we would use for everything related to the company and not just focus one one aspect of the company. Some of the initial logos were in the circles I wanted to make sure the logo looked good at a small size especially on a bottle cap. Meghan drew the initial flame and I added the crossed fire wood to the logo. Once we had this drawn we knew this was the solution we were going to focus on. Its short, simple and to the point. The mark is easily recognizable and fans of the show would get the tie in.

          p I was working on bottle neck label designs the patterns come from the shapes within a hop. You can see one of the early options in the rectangle set in perspective. We were going to use an alarm clock as a logo early on. The flame option was chosen instead to be used for both the apparel and the brewing company. Another thing to note is the label concept in the top left where the type is run vertically. Originally, I wanted the labels to be dry erase so we could reuse the bottles and just write the brew name on the label.
          img(src="/img/thoughts/midnight-society-brewery-logo-process-4.jpg" alt="Sketches of the logo for Midnight Society")
          p I further refined the logo and experimented with different options for the label. We wanted to have a cryptic feel associated with the brand. To do this, I played with setting the type in a way that had to be deciphered. This is where I started incorperating the stars and the moon to give the branding the feel of a secret organization.
          img(src="/img/thoughts/midnight-society-brewery-logo-process-5.jpg" alt="Sketches of the logo for Midnight Society")
          p This is where I started to play with incorporating the grain and hops into the design. The use of the flame show the how versatile the mark can be.
          img(src="/img/thoughts/midnight-society-brewery-logo-process-6.jpg" alt="Sketches of the logo for Midnight Society")
          p This was some play that I was doing to see if I could find another creative direction for the logo.

          p On the left is the regular logo and on the right is the alternative logo. The context the logo will be used in will dictate wich logo is used.

          p Here is our hard work put together. We ended up not using the neck labels. We are now using them for promotional purposes.
