            | It started with a trip to the Salvador Dali museum. All of Dali's work blew me away. I was particularly drawn to the Hallucinogenic Toreador. Especially how depending on where you stood in relation to the painting you could see different images in the painting.
          p 
            | All of the layers of meaning, the visual richness, and scale inspired me. After that trip I knew I wanted to be a creative. I strive to bring the strength and power to my work. Much like the strength and power Dali brought to his work.

            | Design is a game to me. I play with many different elements to create a solution. My process is an evolution. I begin with a rough conceptual idea. Using the needs of the client and the end user to help define the solution. I meet the goals for the project and create a solution to users problems.
