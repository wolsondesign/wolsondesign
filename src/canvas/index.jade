          h3 EverBank Loan Officer website
          p At EverBank I was a dedicated UX designer for the Retail Loan Origination division. The division supported Retail Loan Officers (RLO). RLOs go out into the world and bring in Loans for the bank. Because of this they need marketing material to support them. Each RLO has a specialized website. The goal of the project was to make the entire loan process more efficient from start to finish.

          h3 AIGA Jacksonville
          p I joined AIGA Jacksonville as it’s web chair in August 2014. When I came on board I looked at the status of the site and found. The site did not have a plan for conversions nor did we leverage it’s analytics. I started by asking other chair members what their goals were. Then I created a strategy that would support the chapter's goals. This strategy coupled with member interviews at events would form the basis of my work on the site.

          h3 FontSlate website
          p FontSlate started as a student project at SCAD. Our professor gave us an open project. We could design anything we wanted. These types of projects can be daunting. Because of how open they are. But I found a strong direction for the project by thinking of a problem I had at school. Professors would tell me I was using the wrong font for a project. But when I asked why it was the wrong font. I would not get a straight answer. It wasn't until I started looking up fonts and their history.
