            h2 How we added flavor in every concept for the campaign.
            p After our kick-off meeting, I sat down with Ryan Huffman and Josh Poag to brainstorm the direction for the campaign. Ryan and I came with the concept of 
              em press conference
              | . Josh Poag and I sat down and came up with two other concepts one being 
              em hot wing huddle 
              | and the other
              em Flavor Four
              |.

            p Based on the release schedule. We needed to create three sizes of still banners. They became our canvas for the ideas we created. Ryan created the initial roughs for 
              em press conference
              | . I then took the designs and finalized them. I then completed the designs for 
              em hot wing huddle 
              | and 
              em Flavor Four 
              | banners. At this point, we sent the three options to the client for review.

            p After, we sent out the three initial design options to the client. The client chose to go with 
              em Flavor Four 
              | for the direction of the campaign. For there we refined the look and the feel of the campaign to fit with existing Zaxby's branding. After making the changes, we used the visuals as a backbone for the rest of the pieces that followed.

            p Keeping to the theme of the beer signs. I wanted to create the promotional messaging that looked like a beer sign. Instead of the brewery logo, there would be an icon. Where the Beer name would be. The message would appear. Once I created this formula. I started making church and bar icons into neon signs. Once I create a bank of icons I started creating lines that would compliment the icons.

          .col-1-2
            p The lines I created had a Christian message with a bar term added in. It complemented the idea of bar meets church. It also added a playful tongue in cheek feeling to the messaging. This playfulness helps to break down people's defenses. So they can start to lighten up on the stigma of church and bar. Once I had the building blocks of the brand created. I focused on applying the pieces in context.

              p I started by creating the social media avatar and cover photo. I mocked-up the twitter profile to see what it would look like in context. I wanted the avatar and cover photo to convey the brand in the simplest way possible. I accomplished this through using the symbols created for the brand. Which underlines the theme of the project. That is, keep things as simple as possible. Since the profile was set I moved onto the WordPress theme.

              p I mocked-up a masthead for a blog based on the specs Tom gave me. But I found out Tom was not happy with the theme he was using for his blog. We sat down and walked through a few themes. We decided that the theme "Activello" looked the best and met his technical needs. From there I mocked-up what the blog would look like with the brand applied to it. After I handed off the flats the project was complete.
