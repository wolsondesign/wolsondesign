          h5 Student at SCAD
          p I designed this poster for a lecture series at SCAD. The concept relates to font creation after helvetic. How foundries have continued to flourish despite the “perfect” typeface being helvetica.

            p The ispiration for the poster was drawn from. The Emigre issue "On the shoulders of giants". I was drawn to the idea of people using and learning from what came before us. Not idolizing work to the point of not creating because what has com before us.
