          h5 Co-Creator, Writer
          p Raisin Hell is a brainchild of mine, inspired by equal parts California Raisins and Die Hard. A comic that follows a GMO raisin named Brazen Raisin. Brazen is an assassin for the USDA, who received permanent finger guns from the agency. He has an oath to protect the interest of the agency at all costs. But there is an enemy growing in the shadows that will test everything that makes him a raisin.

            p When coming up with the wordmark. I wanted it incorporated in to the frame. Because it is an efficient use of space. That way we didn't have to loose room to a big masthead. After I wrote the story. Roy created the rough layout. From there I chose to put the wordmark on the wall behind the villain in the opening frame. I created several different versions. We chose the best version and roy incorporated it into the frame. I like how the wordmark helped to present the shady atmosphere of the restaurant.

            p Roy and I create this comic for the creative collaborative Syndicate Division. The inspiration for the byline comes from the USDA seal of approval. Its a subtle nod to the agency Brazen works for. This the first issue does not go into the connection yet. But it will become clear in future editions.

            h2 When it all comes together
            p Roy and I worked together to create the story and visual direction of the comic. The idea for the first issue started as a conversion Roy and I had. About  how terrible it is the think you are about the eat a chocolate chip cookie only to find out itâ€™s a raisin cookie. Collaborating with Roy was a good exercise in story writing. Showing me how comic books can make my vision come to life.
