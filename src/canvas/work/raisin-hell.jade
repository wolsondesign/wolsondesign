          h1 The California Raisins meets Die Hard
          p Raisin Hell is a brainchild of mine, inspired by equal parts California Raisins and Die Hard. The story follows a genetically modified raisin that is an assassin for the USDA named Brazen Raisin. He was given permanent finger guns by the government. He is dedicated to the interest of the USDA and what ever adventures that entails.
          p For our first issue Brazen possess as a chocolate chip in a cookie in order to gain access to a henchman who works for the Order of the cupcake. The Order is dedicated creating the perfect cupcake and forcing everyone to only eat their version of the cupcake. It is upto Brazen to stop them.

          h2 wordmark
          p Aside from writing the story I created the lettering and byline for the comic. For the lettering I wanted to create a wordmark that was incorporated into the comic. After storyboarding with Roy we decided the best placement for the wordmark would be on the wall of the restaurant. This added to the tone we were trying to create in the restaurant. Having graffiti on the wall perfectly summed up the type of place an Order of the cupcake henchman would go.

          h2 byline
          p The byline for the comic was inspired by the USDA seal of approval. It is a subtle hint that makes the connection to the agency. But it doesn't tell all. The link will be made more clear in future issues. In respect to story pacing we don’t want to give everything away. What’s the fun in that. Keep your eye out on my Dribbble for leaks and process shots.

          h2 When it all comes together
          p Roy and I worked together to create the story and visual direction of the comic. We would bounce ideas off each other. Like how terrible it is the think you are about the eat a chocolate chip cookie only to find out it’s a raisin cookie. We also made the decision to use a two color approach to the comic in order to keep the print costs down for us. Collaborating with Roy was a good exercise in story writing and how one can use the comic book medium to have your vision come to life.
