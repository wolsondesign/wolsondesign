          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>I was hired to design the logo and establish the branding for a Beer Growler Store. After sitting down with the owner and looking at the uses of the logos. We came to the conclusion that a primary, secondary, and wordmark were needed. The owner of the company was inspired by antique German Beer posters. This was the starting point for the branding.</p>

          <h2>Primary logo</h2>
          <p>The primary logo was designed to be used as the face of the company and appear on most of the marketing materials for the company. The mark consists of an Eagle with a hop on it’s chest and wheat coming out of it’s tail. The goal was to combine the strength of German design with the American style of illustrating an eagle.</p>

        <h2>Wordmark</h2>
        <p>The typeface used for the wordmark is custom made. I took the black letter font from House Industries Photo Lettering online app. I wanted to use the black letter because it plays off the the strength that German design is known for. But, I altered it to give it a modern spin. The terminals are toned down. The typeface is still showing its calligraphic roots but it now looks more machine made.</p>

        <h2>Secondary logo</h2>
        <p>The secondary mark was designed to be used at small sizes. The mark was made to be on materials that had already established the primary mark or wordmark. Such as the front of a cap or t-shirt. The mark features a growler with the eagle head from the primary mark. The wheat surrounds the mark in the way a laurel wreath sounds someones head.</p>
        <h2>Color palette</h2>
        <p>The color palette was kept simple to allow the strength of the designs to show through. But, the colors chosen were inspired by the German flag. But the color were intended to be used on a way that the concept wouldn’t beat you over the head. For instance the red yellow and black could not be used in all together on the mark. Instead you could use a combination of the colors.</p>

        <h2>The growler</h2>
        <p>I was inspired by German Family crests when I was working with different versions of the logo. This mark was ultimately rejected but, it found life in another use case. I thought about how the mark fit the contours of the growler the owner was looking to use. I photoshopped the mark onto the growler and immediately fell in love with how the mark worked on the growler. Its nice to see something you create find new life.</p>
